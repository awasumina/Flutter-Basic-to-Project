# dashatar_app

This Project creates a simple Flutter application called "Dashatar App." It imports necessary packages for audio playback and Flutter material design. The main function initializes the app, which is a stateful widget MyApp with a StatefulWidget. The app's state (_MyAppState) manages variables for the app bar color, scaffold color, a list of colors, a random number generator, and an audio file name for a kick sound effect. The build method returns a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an app bar, a body with a container showing an image button. When the button is pressed, it triggers random color changes for the app bar and body, plays the kick sound effect, and updates the UI using setState.
