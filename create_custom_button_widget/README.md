# create_custom_button_widget

The project implements a custom rounded button widget called RoundedButton, which extends StatelessWidget and accepts parameters such as button name, icon, background color, text style, and callback function. The widget utilizes an ElevatedButton with a custom style to create rounded buttons with specified properties. In the main.dart file, the custom button widget is used within a MyHomePage widget, where two instances of RoundedButton are displayed vertically using a Column widget. Each button has its own text, icon (optional), background color, and callback function to perform actions when pressed. The MaterialApp theme is customized with a ColorScheme to define the overall color scheme of the app. Overall, the code demonstrates the creation and usage of a reusable custom button widget in a Flutter application.
