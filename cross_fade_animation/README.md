# cross_fade_animation

The Flutter project demonstrates a basic application structure using the MaterialApp widget for theming and navigation. The main app, MyApp, sets the primary color scheme to deep purple and uses Material3 design elements. It initializes a MyHomePage widget as the home screen with a custom title. The MyHomePage widget is a StatefulWidget that manages a boolean value isFirst, which controls the state of an AnimatedCrossFade widget. The AnimatedCrossFade widget smoothly transitions between two child widgets based on the value of isFirst, creating a cross-fade effect. Inside initState, a Timer is set to trigger a reload function after 4 seconds, which toggles the value of isFirst, causing the cross-fade animation to occur. The app's AppBar uses the primary color from the theme, providing a cohesive look to the interface. Overall, the code showcases a simple yet effective way to implement animated transitions in a Flutter application.
