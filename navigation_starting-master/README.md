# navigation_starting
This Flutter project defines a simple application with multiple routes for different screen sizes. The `main.dart` file sets up the application and uses the `url_strategy` package to handle URL routing. The `routes.dart` file contains logic for generating different routes based on screen size, and there are separate files for the home and about pages for both web and mobile platforms.

The `main.dart` file initializes the app with a MaterialApp widget, where routes are generated dynamically using `onGenerateRoute` by calling the `Routes.generateRoute` method defined in `routes.dart`.

In `routes.dart`, the `Routes` class contains a `generateRoute` method that switches between different routes based on the route name. It checks the screen width using a `LayoutBuilder` and navigates to the appropriate page (HomeWeb, HomeMobile, AboutWeb, or AboutMobile).

Each page (`HomeWeb`, `HomeMobile`, `AboutWeb`, `AboutMobile`) is a StatefulWidget with a scaffold containing a centered column. Each page displays a title, some text (passed as arguments), and a button to navigate back.

Overall, this code demonstrates a responsive Flutter application with dynamic routing based on screen size.
