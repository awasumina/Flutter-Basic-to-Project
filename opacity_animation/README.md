# opacity_animation

It creates a simple application that demonstrates the use of the `AnimatedOpacity` widget to control the opacity of a container widget based on user interaction. The main structure consists of a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and a centered `Column` widget inside the body. Within the column, there's an `AnimatedOpacity` widget wrapped around a blue-colored container.

The key feature here is the `AnimatedOpacity` widget, which takes parameters like `opacity`, `duration`, and `curve` to animate changes in opacity smoothly. Initially, the `myOpacity` variable is set to `1.0`, making the container fully opaque. When the user taps the "Change Opacity" button, the opacity toggles between `0.0` (completely transparent) and `1.0` (fully opaque). This change in opacity is animated over a duration of 1 second with a slow-middle curve, providing a visually appealing transition effect.

The code also includes a `visible` boolean variable, although it's not used in the current implementation. This variable could be utilized to control the visibility of widgets along with opacity for more complex animations or interactions in the future.

Overall, this Flutter code snippet serves as a basic example of how to incorporate opacity animations using `AnimatedOpacity`, offering a starting point for developers looking to create dynamic and interactive UI elements in their Flutter applications.
