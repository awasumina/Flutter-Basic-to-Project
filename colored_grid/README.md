# colored_grid

The colored grid is composed of colored container that are arranged using the widget GridView. 3 constructor method used to create a GridView are :GridView.count, GridView.extent, GridView.builder.  GridView.count is a constructor method used to create a GridView widget with a fixed number of children along the cross axis.GridView.extent is a constructor method used to create a GridView widget with fixed maximum extent along the cross axis. GridView.builder is a constructor method used to create a scrollable grid layout with a large number of children, where the children are built lazily on-demand. This is particularly useful when dealing with a large or infinite number of items because it only creates the widgets that are currently visible on the screen, improving performance and reducing memory usage.
