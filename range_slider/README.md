# range_slider_bar

The Range Slider Bar demonstrates the implementation of a Range Slider widget within a Flutter application. A Range Slider allows users to select a range of values by sliding between a minimum and maximum value. 
In this project, the `RangeSlider` widget is placed within the `MyHomePage` widget's `build` method. The `RangeSlider` is initialized with `RangeValues(0, 1)`, indicating the initial minimum and maximum values of the slider. The `labels` property is used to display the current selected range values as labels above the slider. When the user interacts with the slider by moving the thumbs to adjust the range, the `onChanged` callback is triggered, updating the `values` with the new selected range and triggering a rebuild of the widget to reflect the changes visually. The slider is styled with an active color of green and divided into 10 divisions (`divisions: 10`), making it easier for users to select precise ranges within the slider. Overall, this code creates a functional range slider UI component in a Flutter app for selecting and displaying a range of values.
