The Flutter application is structured into several key files. The `main.dart` file initializes Firebase services and sets up the application's main structure using Riverpod for state management and responsive handling. Firebase configurations for different platforms are stored in `firebase_options.dart`, ensuring seamless integration across web, Android, and iOS. The `view_model.dart` file manages user authentication, data fetching from Firestore, and logging activities. It provides methods for user registration, login, and Google sign-in. 
 
Additionally, there are placeholder widgets `LoginViewMobile`, `LoginViewWeb` for handling user login interactions with text fields, buttons, and Google sign-in functionality. Users can sign in using their Google accounts through a button in the LoginViewMobile and LoginViewWeb widget. On web platforms, the signInWithPopup method initiates a popup for Google account selection, while on mobile, the GoogleSignIn plugin prompts users to choose their account. Firebase handles the authentication, granting access upon successful verification. Error handling ensures users are notified of any issues during the sign-in process, maintaining a smooth and secure authentication experience.
