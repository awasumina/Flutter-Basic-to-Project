# list_view_scrollview_3d_list

The project creates a basic mobile application that displays a scrollable list of numbers using the ListWheelScrollView widget. The application is structured using MaterialApp and Scaffold widgets, providing the necessary structure and layout for the app.

 The body of the app is a Center widget containing a ListWheelScrollView widget. This scrollable view displays a list of numbers from 1 to 9, arranged vertically. Each number is wrapped in a Container widget with a blue background color, centered horizontally and vertically within the container. The numbers are styled with a bold white font of size 24, providing good contrast against the blue background.
