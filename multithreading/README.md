# multithreading

This Flutter project showcases multithreading using isolates. It consists of a stateful widget, `MyApp`, with a floating action button that increments a counter when pressed and spawns an isolate to execute a function called `multithreadingFunction` with an input of 100. The `multithreadingFunction` increments a counter and prints even numbers during its execution. The app's UI includes a centered column displaying the current counter value. This setup illustrates the use of isolates for concurrent processing in Flutter, separating the heavy computation of `multithreadingFunction` from the main UI thread.
