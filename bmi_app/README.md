# bmi_app

This  code creates a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application. It begins by importing the necessary Flutter material package for building the UI. 

The `MyHomePage` class is a stateful widget representing the home screen of the app. It contains text fields for inputting weight in kilograms, height in feet, and height in inches. When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, it triggers a BMI calculation based on the provided values. Depending on the calculated BMI, the app displays a message indicating whether the user is underweight, overweight, or within a healthy range. The background color of the app changes dynamically based on the BMI category.

The UI is structured using Scaffold, AppBar, TextFields, ElevatedButton, and Text widgets within a Column layout. Text styling and padding are applied to enhance the visual appearance of the app. Overall, this code showcases a basic implementation of a BMI calculator with real-time feedback based on user input.
