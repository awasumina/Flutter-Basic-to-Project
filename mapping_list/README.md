# mapping_list
The project creates a simple app with a ListView displaying contact information. The app consists of a MaterialApp with a Scaffold containing an AppBar and a body. The body is a Container with a ListView that dynamically generates ListTiles based on data in the 'arrData' list. Each ListTile displays the name, mobile number, and an unread count represented by a colored CircleAvatar. Icons are used for a visual representation of each contact. The app efficiently organizes and presents contact information in a user-friendly manner, making it easy for users to browse and access relevant details.
