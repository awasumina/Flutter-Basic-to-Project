# launch_pad 

This Flutter project creates a simple music launch pad app. It imports necessary packages such as 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart' and 'package:flutter/material.dart' for audio playback and UI design, respectively. MyApp is a stateless widget that defines the app's UI, including the title, app bar, and a grid of Pad widgets. Each Pad widget represents a playable music note with customizable colors and audio files. Tapping a Pad triggers an animation, changes its colors, and plays the associated audio file using the AudioPlayer package. The Pad widget is a stateful widget to manage its internal state, including color changes and audio playback. Overall, this code implements a basic music pad interface with interactive elements for playing sounds.
