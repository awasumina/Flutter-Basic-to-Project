# state_management_provider

The project consists of two main Dart files: `main.dart` and `counter_view.dart`, along with a `CounterViewModel` class in a separate file. In `main.dart`, the Flutter application is initiated with `MyApp` as the entry point, which is a stateless widget defining the overall structure of the app using MaterialApp, with `CounterView` as the home screen. 

Moving to `counter_view.dart`, it contains the `CounterView` widget, a stateful component responsible for displaying a counter and handling user interactions. This widget utilizes the Provider package for state management, creating a ChangeNotifierProvider for `CounterViewModel`. The `_CounterViewState` class manages the state of `CounterView`, with its build method constructing the UI elements such as an app bar, a central counter display, and a floating action button for incrementing the count.

Lastly, the `CounterViewModel` class encapsulates the logic for managing the counter state. It extends ChangeNotifier to notify listeners (like `CounterView`) when the state changes, primarily through the `increment` method that updates the count and triggers a UI refresh. Overall, the code follows Flutter's MVVM architecture, ensuring a separation of concerns between the UI presentation (`CounterView`) and the state management (`CounterViewModel`).
