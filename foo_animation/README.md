# foo_animation

The code creates a dynamic user interface using animated containers and buttons. The app starts with a MaterialApp containing a Scaffold with an AppBar and a body consisting of a Column widget. Inside the Column, there's a Center widget containing an AnimatedContainer that adjusts its width, height, and decoration based on button clicks. The app utilizes stateful widgets to manage changes in container dimensions and decoration, enabling smooth animations between different visual states. Overall, it demonstrates how Flutter's animation features can be harnessed to create engaging and interactive user experiences.
